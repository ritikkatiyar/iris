# iris
Assume that a hobby botanist is interested in distinguishing the species of some iris flowers that she has found. She has collected some measurements associated with each iris. The dataset includes three iris species with 50 samples each as well as some properties about each flower. 

One flower species is linearly separable from the other two, but the other two are not linearly separable from each other.

The columns in this dataset are:
 Id
 SepalLengthCm
 SepalWidthCm
 PetalLengthCm
 PetalWidthCm
 Species
You will consider that these are the only species our botanist will encounter.
The goal is to create a Neural Network model that can learn from the measurements of these irises whose species are already known so that we can predict the species for the new irises that she has found
